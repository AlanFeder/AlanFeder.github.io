<p>Welcome! I am a data scientist with 10+ years of experience in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics, and Data Science.  Most recently, I worked as a Senior Principal Data Scientist at Invesco for the past 5 years.  Previously, I worked as a data scientist at AIG (on the "Science" team).  Before that, I had worked as a Casualty Pricing Actuary at Swiss Re, passing the first 5 exams (only missing one to receive the ACAS). </p>

<p>I received Bachelors and Masters degrees from Columbia University, with a BA in Mathematics (concentrated in Economics) and an MA in Statistics.</p>

<p>After living in Manhattan for 16 years, I currently live in Maryland, right outside Washington, DC with my wife and two amazing children.</p>
