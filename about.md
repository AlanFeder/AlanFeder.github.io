<p>Welcome! I am a data scientist with 10+ years of experience in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics, and Data Science.  </p>
<p>I am currently searching for my next professional adventure in the data science world.  I am have expertise using machine learning and data science to solve real-world problems, working with business partners to craft projects and products that empower them to succeed.  In addition to training well-performing models, I love using data visualization to express the ML outputs and insights in ways that allow clients to understand what their data is telling them.</p>
<p>I currently live in Maryland, right outside Washington, DC.  I am open to positions that are in the DC area or remote.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Most recently, I worked as a Senior Principal Data Scientist at Invesco for the past 5 years.  Previously, I worked as a data scientist at AIG (on the "Science" team).  Before that, I had worked as a Casualty Pricing Actuary at Swiss Re, passing the first 5 exams. </p>

<p>I graduated from Columbia University, receiving a BA in Mathematics (minored in Economics) and an MA in Statistics.</p>

<p>After living in Manhattan for 16 years, I currently live in Maryland with my wife and two children.</p>
