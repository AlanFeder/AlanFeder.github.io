<p>Welcome! I am a data scientist with 10+ years of experience in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics, and Data Science.  </p>
<p>I am currently working as a Staff LLM Data Scientist at [Magnifi](https://magnifi.com/) by [TIFIN](https://tifin.com) building an AI-powered copilot for investments.  I have expertise in using machine learning and data science to solve real-world problems, working with business partners to craft projects and products that empower them to succeed.  My best professional moments have been successfully translating the business needs into machine learning code, and then using data visualization and analytics to express the technical outputs and insights in ways that allow our partners to understand what the data is telling them and how it relates to their goals.</p>
<p>I currently live in Maryland, right outside Washington, DC.  I am open to positions either in the DC area or those that are remote. </p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Most recently, I worked as a Senior Principal Data Scientist at Invesco for the past 5 years.  Previously, I worked as a data scientist at AIG (on the "Science" team).  Before that, I had worked as a Casualty Pricing Actuary at Swiss Re, passing the first 5 exams. </p>

<p>I graduated from Columbia University, receiving a BA in Mathematics (minored in Economics) and an MA in Statistics.</p>

<p>After living in Manhattan for 16 years, I currently live in Maryland with my wife and two children.</p>
