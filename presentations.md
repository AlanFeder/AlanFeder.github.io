<small>As NLP has exploded within the world of Data Science and Machine Learning, it is now everywhere in finance as well. Many of us have heard about using NLP to try to outperform the market and predict stock prices. However, NLP is much more versatile than that, and has many other uses as well throughout the finance world. In this talk, I explore a number of methodologies within NLP, explaining how they are being used in finance to help professionals do their job more efficiently and effectively.</small>

<p>Categorical embeddings are a relatively new method, utilizing methods popularized in Natural Language Processing that help models solve this problem and can help you understand more about the categories themselves.</p>
<small>When building a predictive model in R, many of the functions (such as `lm()`, `glm()`, `randomForest`, `xgboost`, or neural networks in `keras`) require that all input variables are numeric. If your data has categorical variables, you may have to choose between ignoring some of your data and too many new columns.</small>

<small>Categorical embeddings are a relatively new method, utilizing methods popularized in Natural Language Processing that help models solve this problem and can help you understand more about the categories themselves.</small>

<small>While there are a number of online tutorials on how to use Keras (usually in Python) to create these embeddings, this talk uses <a href="https://embed.tidymodels.org/reference/step_embed.html">`embed::step_embed()`</a>, an extension of the `recipes` package, to create the embeddings.</small>

<small>When building predictive machine learning models, many data scientists feel a need to choose between a traditional regression model and a complex model that performs better but is more of an inscrutable black box.  In this talk, I will show a number of methods that let us understand what drives the complex models without having to sacrifice accuracy.</small>
